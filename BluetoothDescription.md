**Technical Details Regarding Bluetooth**


Bluetooth uses a radio signal technology called the frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) which makes it rare for multiple devices interconnected to be transmitting on the same frequency at the same time. The range of a Bluetooth device is to about 10 meters which is transmitted by a weak signal of just 1 miliwatt. Even so, Bluetooth doesn’t require line of sight between devices. The walls won’t stop a Bluetooth signal, making the standard rather useful for controlling several devices in different rooms.

Bluetooth comes with its different standards (version 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 2.1,3.0). Although different products support different standards, They are backwards compatible. For an instance, a Bluetooth 2.0 phone will connect to a Bluetooth 1.0 hand-free headset with no issues at stake.
