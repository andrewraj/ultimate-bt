The reasons why did we decided to develop this application:-

  * The main benefit of using the application is the ability to communicate without the necessity for an internet connection. This may come handy mainly when there is no network coverage within the area.


  * This application can be used as an alternative in such situation to intercommunicate messages between two devices within the signal range.  The second reason is quite apparent. It is inexpensive. As cited from the former statement, There is no need for an internet connection. Therefore, there is no cost involved for its usage and functionality.

We decided to develope the application on an Android platform. Itâ€™s popular and widely used among mobile consumers. Besides, the Android SDK provides the essential tools and APIs necessary to develop the application to make things less complicated and much more implicit.
